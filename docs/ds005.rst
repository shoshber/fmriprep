ds005
=====

``fmriprep``'s ds005 pipeline is used on datasets for which there are only t1ws and at least one functional (EPI) file.
Use the `--workflow-type ds005` or allow ``fmriprep`` to automatically determine the approriate workflow.

What It Does
------------

BIDSDatasource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This node reads the BIDS_-formatted t1 data.

t1w_preprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: t1w_preprocessing.dot.png
    :scale: 100%

The t1w_preprocessing sub-workflow finds the skull stripping mask and the
white matter/gray matter/cerebrospinal fluid segments and finds a non-linear
warp to the MNI space.

    Segmentation (FAST).

EPI_HMC
~~~~~~~

.. image:: EPI_HMC.dot.png
    :scale: 100%

The EPI_HMC sub-workflow collects BIDS_-formatted EPI files, performs head
motion correction, and skullstripping.

    Brain extraction (nilearn).

ref_epi_t1_registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ref_epi_t1_registration.dot.png
    :scale: 100%

The ref_epi_t1_registration sub-workflow uses FSL FLIRT with the BBR cost
function to find the transform that maps the EPI space into the T1-space.

    :scale: 100%

EPIMNITransformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: EPIMNITransformation.dot.png
    :scale: 100%

The EPIMNITransformation sub-workflow uses the transform from
`EPIMeanNormalization`_ and a t1-to-MNI transform from `t1w_preprocessing`_ to
map the EPI image to standardized MNI space.
It also maps the t1w-based mask to MNI space.

Transforms are concatenated and applied all at once, with one interpolation
step, so as little information is lost as possible.

ConfoundDiscoverer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ConfoundDiscoverer.dot.png
    :scale: 100%

Given a motion-corrected fMRI, a brain mask, MCFLIRT movement parameters and a
segmentation, the ConfoundDiscoverer sub-workflow calculates potential
confounds per volume.

Calculated confounds include the mean global signal, mean tissue class signal,
tCompCor, aCompCor, Frawise Displacement, 6 motion parameters and DVARS.


Reports
-------

``fmriprep`` outputs summary reports and reportlets (reports of individual steps in the process).
These reports provide visuals to make visual inspection of the results easy.

Derivatives
-----------

There are additional files, called "Derivatives", outputted to ``<output dir>/derivatives``.
See the BIDS_ spec for more information.

Derivatives related to t1w files are in the ``anat`` subfolder:

- ``*T1w_brainmask.nii.gz`` Brain mask derived using ANTS or AFNI, depending on the command flag ``--skull-strip-ants``
- ``*T1w_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_brainmask.nii.gz`` Same as above, but in MNI space.
- ``*T1w_dtissue.nii.gz`` Tissue class map derived using FAST.
- ``*T1w_preproc.nii.gz`` Bias field corrected t1w file, using ANTS' N4BiasFieldCorrection
- ``*T1w_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_preproc.nii.gz`` Same as above, but in MNI space
- ``*T1w_target-meanBOLD_affine.txt`` The ITK-formatted affine to transform T1w into the EPI space, created by FSL and converted by C3DAffineTool
- ``*T1w_target-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_affine.mat`` The affine matrix to transform T1w into MNI space
- ``*T1w_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_class-CSF_probtissue.nii.gz``
- ``*T1w_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_class-GM_probtissue.nii.gz``
- ``*T1w_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_class-WM_probtissue.nii.gz`` Probability tissue maps, transformed into MNI space
- ``*T1w_target-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_warp.nii.gz`` Warp transform to transform t1w into MNI space

Derivatives related to EPI files are in the ``func`` subfolder:

- ``*bold_brainmask.nii.gz`` Brain mask for EPI files, calculated by BET on the average EPI volume, post-motion correction
- ``*bold_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_brainmask.nii.gz`` Same as above, but in MNI space
- ``*bold_confounds.tsv`` A tab-separated value file with one column per calculated confound and one row per timepoint/volume
- ``*bold_preproc.nii.gz`` Motion-corrected (using MCFLIRT) EPI file.
- ``*bold_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_preproc.nii.gz`` Same as above, but in MNI space
- ``*bold_target-T1w_affine.txt`` The ITK-formatted affine to transform the EPI into T1w space (the inverse of ``anat/*T1w_target-meanBOLD_affine.txt``)

Images
------

The ``images`` subfolder of the output directory contains images (e.g., ``.svg``, ``.png``) produced by `fmriprep`.
Each image is accompanied by a ``.json`` file that contains metadata about how the image was produced.
